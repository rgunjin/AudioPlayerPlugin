# AudioPlayerPlugin

JUCE-powered audio plugin for playback audio files and testing my further development.

This plugin was inspired by the JUCE tutorial, a video from the The Audio Programmer YouTube channel and the jonathonracz project. This was created because I needed a plugin capable of:
- Playing audio files of various formats
- Open source
- Cross platform
- Lightweight

Although similar plugins have already been written, I wanted to write my own in order to better understand the architectural issues that arise when creating such applications. I use it in conjunction with the JUCE plugin host example to create a fast and lightweight environment for testing and debugging my new audio plugins. I'm planning to add new features and pretty it up a bit in the future such as a scrollbar for scaling audio thumbnails and a playlist.
